		<h2>My Professional Experience</h2>
			<p>I completed high school here in Washington and then started my college career at Hampton University in VA and finished at Chicago State University in Chicago, Il. A city where the motto on voting day is "Vote early, Vote often". But thats another story.  I have done some graduate work at various places on MBA and MS degrees but not completed any additional degrees.</p>

				<p>B.S. in Mathematics</p>
			</div> -->
			<p>I have acquired two certifications along the way.  The Project Management Professional (PMP) and the ITIL certification.</p>
			<p>I was a programmer for over 20 years.  I programmed primarily in Cobol and Assembler.  Using all kinds of files and databases.  I had the opportunity to work at some amazing places.  First of which was Bell Laboratories.  That by itself is its own story!</p>
			<p>Then...  I went to the dark side.  Management!  The lure of the dark side was just too strong and I have spent many years working back toward the light. Along the way I have managed projects both small and large.  Three people to 75.  Offshore programmers. Multiple locations.  But now, its time to head back to the light and become a developer again in a new world!</p>
			<p>I am so looking forward to the career change and the new challenges that await me along this path.  I have already discovered that I have to make a complete paradigm shift in how I view programming.  The accumulated knowledge of libraries of code make the new world of programming an exciting vibrant place with virtually no limit to what can be accomplished.  Every new library of code makes Sir Isaac Newton even more correct with his legendary statement.</p>
			<p>IF I HAVE SEEN FURTHER THAN OTHERS, IT IS BY STANDING UPON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS!</p>
