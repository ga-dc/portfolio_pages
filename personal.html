			<p>I have been married for 12.5 years to Jocelyn.  We have a 14 year old son, Jordan who is in the 8th grade.  He is such a remarkable drummer that we have nicknamed him our retirement plan.  But I digress, after all this is all about me!  I also have a 32 year old daughter, Nia who lives in Atlanta. And please don't forget the pets.  Two cats, Sanibel and Onyx and 40 pound hound puppy named Rogue.</p>
			<p>We actually live in Washington, DC.  I am a native Washingtonian. I graduated from Wilson high school in NW awhile ago!</p>
			<h3>Fun Stuff</h3>
			<p>I am a sports fanatic.  Especially for the Washington Football Team.  This last year was my first without season tickets in 50 years.  I even attended their last appearance in the SuperBowl. Why was that in Minneapolis?!?!?!?!?  At least it was a domed stadium, but again, I digress.  I love participating as well as watching.  Over the years, I have played too much basketball, lots of football, earned a first degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do.  Really love skiing even though I don't do it enough.  Played a little tennis, some racquetball and now I am addicted to golf. Skiing and Golf are the easiest ways that I have found to spend lots of money very quickly on self entertainment...  well... legally.</p>

			<p>Golf and Poker and Live Music.  What can I say?  I love them all.  I never thought I would take to golf like I have.  But I have.  My vacation requirements are now golf and/or poker wherever we go.  I was even chased by an eight foot crocodile on a course in Cancun.  I have been tring to hard to find that picture to post.  And Poker.  You can play poker until your brain stops working.  Thats pretty cool!  It has replaced some of my athletic ventures.</p>
			<p>Finally, I love live music!  Preferably jazz, or old funk like Mandrill, Graham Central Station.  The best performers always sound better in person than they do in the studio.  One of my (many) complaints about our current generation of "musicians" is they only seem to sound magnificent in the studio.</p>
